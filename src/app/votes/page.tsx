        This ratio indicates how often voters choose the left vs the right
        performance from the voting page. This <i>should</i> <Converge /> on
        1.00.

        If this ratio is far from 1:1, then that indicates a bias toward one
        side or the other.

        <p>
          <b>2024-12-07 update</b>: As of now, there are 583 votes and the ratio
          is 1.27:1, which seems to indicate a clear bias being introduced by
          something.
        </p>

        <p>These are my current theories:</p>

        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
          <li>
            <b>Primacy bias</b>: If a voter listens to both performances,
            they&apos;ll probably start with the one on the left, then the one
            on the right, and then the primacy bias will make them favor the
            first one they listened to. I do not have a theory for why primacy
            bias would be stronger than recency bias here though.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Non-random performance ordering</b>: I found a flaw in my
              performance selection logic: I was choosing pairs randomly
              randomly, but for any <i>specific</i> pair of performances, their
              order relative to each other would always be the same.
              Specifically, they&apos;d be in the order that they were added to
              the database, and I initially seeded the database with what I
              believed to be the best performances. I&apos;ve now corrected this
              (the vertical line on the chart indicates when I deployed the
              fix), and the performance order on the vote page is randomized.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Either or both of these could be contributors to the unexpected ratio
          here.

        <p>
          <b>2025-01-05 update</b>: The fix I mentioned in that last update
          seems to have helped. Counting just the votes since then, the ratio is
          1.037:1, which is <i>probably</i> within a reasonable margin of error.
