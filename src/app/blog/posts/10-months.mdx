What's up weirdos - it's been a fun first 10 months for Live Gizz Rankings.

In that time, hundreds of you have collectively submitted thousands of votes on
the site and it's been fun to see which performances have turned out to be
common favorites.
Thank you for your contributions!

## Site updates

I've recently made a handful of improvements that I think you'll enjoy:

- **You can now add and edit performances directly - no need to nominate them
  and wait for me to add them!**
  You'll see new buttons for this on the pages for songs, shows, and
  performances when you're logged in.
- **You can now skip a pair of performances.**
  There's a new "skip" button on the voting page for pairs that are too hard to
  pick between.
  Once you've skipped a pair, you won't see it again.
- **You can now filter a voting session to a specific song.**
  Do this via the "Vote on X performances" button on song pages.
- **Shows can now have multiple videos attached.**
  This is especially useful for residency shows where a single "show" on the
  site corresponds to an entire residency.

Check out the [changelog](/changelog) for the full details.

## Help wanted

If you enjoy the site and want to help out,
there are a few ways you can do that:

- **[Vote](/rank) on some performances.**
- **Add new shows and performances.**
  Now that I've built out the functionality for this,
  anyone can submit or edit shows and performances.
  - I had originally been hesitant to add too many performances to the site for
    fear of destroying the signal-to-noise ratio during voting sessions.
    I still worry about that, but at this point I'd rather find a way to solve
    that problem by improving the voting system rather than limiting the data.
- **Contribute to the
  [codebase](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/live-gizz-rankings) on GitHub.**
  If you need a hand getting started, I'm happy to help.
- **Share feedback and ideas.**
  Find an issue or room for improvement on the site?
  Let me know in [an email](mailto:james@jamesbvaughan.com) or
  [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/live-gizz-rankings/issues)!

Thanks again.
I'm excited to see how all of the performances from recent and upcoming shows
will settle in the rankings.

p.s. Here's me with my siblings on drag day at FoV, for your enjoyment:
