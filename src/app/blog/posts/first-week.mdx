In this first week, the site got hundreds of visitors, over 1000 votes, [a nice
reception on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/1h8gbo8/i_made_a_website_for_finding_the_best_live/),
and lots of helpful feedback.
Thank you to everyone who has voted so far!

Since that Reddit post, I've made a handful of updates and improvements:

**Added:**

- I've added over X new performances based on direct nominations and from more
  scouring of the subreddit for posts where folks are discussing great live
  performances.
- I've added [a page](/votes) where you can see all the votes so far, along with
  some analysis of them.
- I’ve added a “best of” section to album pages where you can see the top rated
  performances for each song on an album. ([example](/albums/petro))
- I've added Spotify embeds for all the 2024 shows that got added to Spotify
  this week.

**Fixed:**

- Signing up to vote now works consistently - thanks /u/katpurz for reporting
  the issue!
- I've fixed some issues with embedded YouTube playback.
- I've updated the logic that selects a pair of performances to make it more
  balanced across songs.

**Misc:**

- I've made
  [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/live-gizz-rankings)
  public. Feel free to poke around!

Those newly-added performances could use some votes, so please go [rank some of
them](/rank)!
