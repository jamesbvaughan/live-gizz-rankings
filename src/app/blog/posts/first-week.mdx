In this first week, the site got over 1000 votes, [a nice reception on the
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/1h8gbo8/i_made_a_website_for_finding_the_best_live/), and lots of helpful feedback.
Thank you to everyone who has voted so far!

Since that Reddit post, I've made a handful of updates and improvements:

**Added:**

- I've added over X new performances based on direct nominations from all of you and from more scouring of the subreddit for posts where folks are discussing great live performances.
- I've added [a page](/votes) where you can see all of the votes so far, along with some analysis of them.
- I’ve added a “best of” section to album pages where you can see the top rated
  performances for each song on an album. ([example](/albums/petro))
- I've added Spotify embeds for all of the 2024 shows that were added to Spotify this week.

**Fixed:**

- Signing up to vote now works consistently - thanks /u/katpurz for reporting the issue!
- Issues with embedded YouTube playback have been fixed.
- I've updated the logic that selects a pair of performances to make it more balanced across songs.

**Misc:**

- I've made [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/live-gizz-rankings) public. Feel free to poke around!

Those newly-added performances could use some votes, so please go [rank some of
them](/rank)!
