You can now edit the site's data directly in the site itself!

Since launching this site nearly a year ago, the data (albums, songs,
shows, and performances) has been hard-coded in JavaScript files that live in
the codebase.

The advantage of that approach is that it made read operations on the data
simple and helped me avoid incurring any data transfer costs for traffic to and
from a database.
The total amount of data is small enough to easily fit in memory, even on
heavily constrained machines, and this gave me a lot of flexibility when
iterating on the site in the early stages.

At this point though, the site is getting enough usage that it's become too
tedious for me to update everything and add nominated performances on my own,
especially when each update requires code changes and a new deployment.

To start solving that problem, I've added a handful of forms for adding and
editing different types of data directly in the site itself.
Most importantly, this mean that any user can now [add performances
directly](/performances/add),
rather than just nominating them for me to add.

There remains a lot of work to do though!
Here are a few specific things I have in mind:

- **Make it easier to get the Bandcamp and YouTube IDs for performances.**
  Right now it's fully manual and it's the slowest part of adding new
  performances to the site.
  It's almost certainly possible to automate this, but I haven't found a good
  way to do it yet.
- **Improve the voting experience.**
  I've got a handful of ideas here.
  The problem is that as the number of performances on the site grows,
  the amount of time voters will need to spend comparing uninteresting pairs of
  performances will grow exponentially.
  Here are a few ways I could improve that:
  - Allow voters to filter a voting session down to a specific album or song.
  - Add an explicit "skip" button to the voting page.
  - Tune the logic for generating pairs of performances to vote on to show
    performances with higher scores more often.

Thanks for following along!
