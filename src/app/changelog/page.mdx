## September 2025

This month I've been working on the biggest updates to site since its initial
launch!

### Content

- Added [Phantom Island](/albums/phantom-island)
- Added all nominated performances
  - From here on out, there will be no more nominated performances since
    everyone can now just add performances directly.

### Site

- Added the ability to add and edit content directly in the site.
  This includes albums, songs, shows, and performances.
  - Read more about this in [the blog
    post](/blog/better-performance-submissions).
- Added the ability to skip a pair of performances.
  Once you skip a pair, you won't see it again.
- Added the ability to filter a voting session to performances of a specific
  song.
- Added the ability to set multiple YouTube videos for a show
  - The primary use for this that I have in mind is for residency shows, where
    one "show" on this site actually corresponds to the entire residency.

### Codebase

- Updated all major dependencies
- Switched from eslint to [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html)
- Moved all data access to use the database
- Added email sending functionality
  - This is currently just for me to get email notifications when edits are
    made.
- Remove seed data files

## May 2025

### Content

- Replaced YouTube links to unofficial uploads of the 2024 shows with links to
  the official uploads.
  (Thank you for
  [your work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2RZCUIldTTWYdUb5tQvfMEWd6EosQd5h),
